If I were a tick, you'd be a flea <br>
And if I were a bird, you'd be a bee <br>
If I were a dog, you'd be a frog <br>
And if I were a stump, you'd be a log <br>
<br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a pebble, you'd be a stone <br>
And if I were a skull, you'd be a bone <br>
If I were an A, you'd be a Z <br>
And If I were you, you'd be me <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a home, you'd be a house <br>
And if I were cheese, you'd be a mouse <br>
If I were the moon, you'd be the sun <br>
And if I were a walk, you'd be a run <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a party, you'd be a rave <br>
And if I were a splash, you'd be a wave <br>
If I were a gutter, you'd be a grate <br>
And if I were early, you'd be late <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a flower, you'd be a tree <br>
And if I were biscuits, you'd be tea <br>
If I were a town, you'd be a city <br>
And if I were cute, you'd be pretty <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a sentance, you'd be a word <br>
And if I were a geek, you'd be a nerd <br>
If I were a bunny, you'd be a hare <br>
And if I were here, you'd be there <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a chuckle, you'd be a laugh <br>
And if I were a shower, you'd be a bath <br>
If I were a pillow, you'd be a bed <br>
And If I were blue, you'd be red <br>
 <br>
Oh buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy on the sea <br>
How  buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy do you put up  <br>
with me? <br>
 <br>
If I were a ship, you'd be the sail <br>
And if I were a fish, you'd be a whale <br>
If I were a captain, you'd be my smee <br>
Because I love you, and you love me <br>
 <br>
For MizSunshine, for being the bestest friend ever and still sitting next to  <br>
me today when I bugged her. I love you Pickle (which she LOVES being  <br>
called by the way). And despite saying how stupid (NOT) this poem is,  <br>
she chipped in a few times when I got stuck for ideas. <br>
 <br>
See, I knew she cared :D <br>
So, my first piece of poetry... That I wrote on a half and a 2 hour  <br>
journey...Lol :D <br>
 <br>
If I were a comment, you'd be a vote <br>
And if I were a fan, you'd be.... A coat???
