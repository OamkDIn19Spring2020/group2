<h1>DOOM ETERNAL</h1><br>
<p style="text-align:center">
Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer, <br>
an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of  <br>
Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game  <br>
continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" <br>
combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage  <br>
enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor.  <br>
The player has access to various firearms, such as  <br>
the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon,  <br>
Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG 9000, and Ballista. <br>
Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the "Crucible Blade"  <br>
energy sword and a retractable arm-blade called the  <br>
"Doomblade" can also be used. The arm-blade provides  <br>
the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent  <br>
"glory kill" executions, which drop extra health.  <br>
The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the "Meat Hook", <br>
a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots <br>
the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook,  <br>
useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation.  <br>
The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted  <br>
Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and  <br>
ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower,  <br>
which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups.  <br>
Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop  <br>
ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing,  <br>
dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been  <br>
introduced.
